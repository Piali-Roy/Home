		<ul>
			<li>Watching documentaries
				<p>
					There is a lot to learn from documentaries, a lot of them are based on injustice and abuse and that helps me to stay 
					informed about issues going on in the world. Personally, my favourite documentaries are about outer space as its always 
					so exciting to see or hear about what may happen in the future and what us humans may accomplish, evertime I finish a
					documentary like that I always get so inspired and it makes me more excited for the future.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>Playing Board Games
				<p>
					I love the teamwork it requires to play a board game that requires some complex strategies to play, its good for 
					building critical thinking skills and an amazing bonding experience if your playing with a team. Board games that 
					require some sort of roleplay and lying/deceit are the most fun, its always funny to hear what other people will 
					say and sometimes the winners can be unexpected.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>Gardening
				<p>
					Growing vegetables is the best thing to do during the summer, it serves as an amazing learning experience because
					you often have to learn about soils, fertilizers, bacterias, and more, it's a great opportunity to get outside, get 
					some exercise and learn in a different way than I am usually used to. It's very nice to go outside and look at the fruit
					of all our hard labor, it tastes very good! My favorite thing to grow is probably squash because the specific type of squash 
					my family grows in our garden grows very, very long, one summer it grew to be as long as me. The best-tasting thing in our
					the garden is the tomatoes, they taste a lot better than the ones found in stores!

			</li>
			<li>Baking
				<p>
					While im very bad at cooking, I am ok at baking, I really like the smell of bread fresh out of the oven and it tastes a lot
					better then bread from grocery stores. The first time I made bread it was a bit of a disaster, I kneaded the bread for 
					over 30 minutes so it was very dense and when I left it to rise it did not do so, I think it was because my house was too cold. 
					The bread ended up coming out very dense, but it still tasted good so it was ok.

			</li>
			<li>Reading
				<p>
					When I was younger I did read quite a bit but as I got older I started to read a lot less, fortunately being stuck at home during 
					this pandemic has encouraged me to pick up some books and start reading, and I really do enjoy it, just like I did when I was younger.
					I enjoy reading because it makes me happier, calmer, allows me to build my vocabulary, and I really like when I read a novel and I 
					imagine what the characters look like, the setting, and visualizing the scenes. <a href = "#ReadingList">Here is my reading list.</a>
